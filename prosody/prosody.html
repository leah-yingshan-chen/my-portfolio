                <p class="overview_left">Research shows that prosody can have a positive effect on second-language listening learning under certain circumstances, but studies on its influence on second-language reading comprehension are limited. This study aims to explore the correlation between prosodic awareness and reading comprehension performance, as well as the role of prosody in English reading comprehension. English learners read short passages while their eye movements were monitored.<br><br>The study shows that prosodic information in the oral reading phase increased the depth of initial processing and the number and duration of reprocessing, reduced further rereading or repetitive reading activities after the voice ended, and improved reading fluency.</p>

                    <p>Reading is the most important means for people to acquire knowledge and information, and it is also the main input way for Chinese learners to learn English. Therefore, reading ability plays a key role in¬†English learning and language output. Foreign language teaching in China also attaches great importance to the cultivation of students' reading ability. The research shows that the phenomenon of "high input and low output" is common in Chinese reading teaching, and the learners' reading comprehension ability is poor, and the reading speed is relatively slow.</p>

                    <p>With the popularization of technology, audio reading generated by "Internet + reading" has become an important way for people to read, and the rhythmic information of audio plays a role in helping information processing. Studies have found that learners with strong prosodic awareness can understand text information more effectively and improve reading efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Basis</h2>
            <h3>PROSODY & PROSODIC SENSITIVITY</h3>
            <p>üîπAt the phonological level, prosody covers different aspects such as intonation, stress and boundary, and can be realized through systematic changes in acoustic parameters such as pitch, duration, and volume (Dowhower, 1991; Yang et al., 2006).</p>
            <p>üî∏Individuals' ability to perceive and recognize suprasemental information such as stress, intonation, and pause is the core cognitive factor in the development of reading abilityÔºå which is prosodic sensitivity (Wei, 2018; Fang & Liu, 2021).</p><br>
            <h3>THE ROLE OF PROSODY IN LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING</h3>
            <h3>üí¨Syntactic Analysis & Information Processing</h3>
            <p>New information is information that has not appeared in context and should usually be stressed. Old information, on the other hand, is information that has already occurred in the context, and is assumed by the speaker to have been understood by the listener, so it is not reread (Halliday, 1967).The research on the regulation of attention resources of stress in oral comprehension shows that stress begins to regulate the allocation of attention resources in the early stage of oral comprehension, and stress is not affected by tone (Zhao & Li, 2016).Strong prosodic boundaries are more conducive to disambiguation of subjects than weak prosodic boundaries (Millotte et al., 2008), and prosodic boundaries have the best effect on resolving structural ambiguity (Wang et al., 2003).</p>
            <h3>üòÄEmotion Expression and Recognition</h3>
            <p>Emotional prosody refers to various changes in pitch, length, intensity, stress and intonation that can express emotions, which sometimes rely on changes in acoustic features rather than semantics and grammar (Lei et al., 2021). Sadness tends to be expressed with relatively low pitch and slower speed, whereas anger, fear, and happiness tend to be expressed with medium or higher pitch and faster speech (An et al., 2017; Ueyama & Li, 2020).</p>
            <h3>üìñReading Comprehension</h3>
            <p>Many researchers have also emphasized the importance of prosody in fluent reading (Kuhn et al., 2010; Rasinski, 2004; Schwanenflugel & Benjamin, 2012). Implicit Prosody Hypothesis (IPH) holds that implicit prosody is a written projection of explicit prosody, which can affect syntactic information processing in reading (Fodor, 2002). The relationship between prosody and reading comprehension is not as strong in younger readers because early reading speed and skill are more important in comprehension. But as students acquire better reading skills, prosody plays an increasingly important role in reading comprehension.</p>

                <h5>Audio-visual input mode of reading</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="q_right">
                <p>Reading while listening has advantages over single-mode input (reading only), and is more attractive to learners (Tragant & Vallbona, 2018). Chang's (2009) research shows that second language learners have better comprehension ability when they listen and read than when they only listen or read. The research of Chang & Millet (2015) shows that compared with the mode of only reading, second language learners in the mode of listening while reading have better listening fluency and text understanding ability.</p>

                <p>This study focuses on the role of prosodic information in background sounds, and how the addition of prosodic information to background sounds will affect the reading process of second language learners. Eye tracking technology is proposed to explore this problem.</p>

            <h2>Research Methods</h2>
            <h3>üë•Participants</h3>
            <p>92 subjects were recruited, 27 male and 63 female. All participants were required to complete a prosodic sensitivity test and an English background questionnaire before the formal experiment. 6 subjects were excluded from the data analysis due to the unsatisfactory effect of eye movement collection, and 84 subjects were retained in the end, including 24 male and 60 female. The reading comprehension and eye movement data were collected.</p><br>
            <h3>üîâMaterials</h3>
            <p>The text material of this study is the "Reading Comprehension Test", which consists of 9 short articles and 27 questions. Two kinds of speech materials (neutral speech and prosodic speech) were used in this study. Each short passage corresponded to the neutral and prosodic versions of speech, and a total of 20 speech materials were collected in the end.</p>
            <h3>ü§ñExperiment Design</h3>
            <p>Single-factor three-level experimental design. The independent variable was reading mode (neutral speech + text, prosodic speech + text, no speech text), and the dependent variable was reading comprehension score and eye movement indicators such as fixation time, fixation number, regression path time, and regression number.</p>
            <h3>üìçProcedure</h3>
            <p>The subjects read the short passages appeared on the screen (accompanied by background speech). After each passage, there are three single-choice questions. Choose the correct one according to the content of the passage. In the formal experiment, the eye tracker recorded subjects‚Äô eye movement and key response, the experiment lasted about 30 minutes. After calibration and screening, all the collected data were recorded into SPSS software, and ANOVA and T-test were used.</p>
