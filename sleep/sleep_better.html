                <p class="overview_left">We have initiated a project to enhance sleep quality among young adults struggling with insomnia. Life pressures, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive screen time contribute to their sleep problems, negatively affecting their health, work, and overall quality of life. Despite these challenges, many young adults lack knowledge about the causes of insomnia and effective strategies to improve their sleep. Our goal is to create an accessible, practical, and personalized platform to help them address their sleep issues.<br><br>*Insomnia: a common sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting good-quality sleep (National Institutes of Health, 2024).<br><br><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sleep-team/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more details in our group website>></a></p>

            <p style="padding-top: 16px;">‚óâ  Gain a foundational understanding of the scientific principles governing sleep.<br>‚óâ  Recognize the critical importance of sleep.<br>‚óâ  Establish basic sleep hygiene practices and behavioral techniques to enhance sleep quality.<br>‚óâ  Cultivate the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented sleep strategies.<br>‚óâ  Harness motivation to actively manage personal sleep health.</p><br>
            <h3>Objectives (Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy)</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 16px;"><b>Remember</b>‚óâ  Define circadian rhythms and explain their significance in regulating sleep-wake cycles.<br>‚óâ  Describe the two-process model of sleep regulation and the roles of melatonin and caffeine.<br>‚óâ  Identify the stages of the sleep cycle and their characteristics (Wake, REM, NREM1, NREM2, SWS).<br><b>Understand</b>‚óâ  Explain how modern factors such as light exposure, temperature, caffeine, alcohol, and alarms affect sleep quality.<br>‚óâ  Discuss the underlying reasons why humans need to sleep and the implications of inadequate sleep on health and well-being.<br><b>Apply</b>‚óâ  Utilize the SATED Sleep Questionnaire, Sleep Diary, and Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) to assess personal sleep fulfillment and hygiene.<br>‚óâ  Practice progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) techniques as a method for reducing stress.<br><b>Analyze</b>‚óâ  Compare cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) and sleep medication in terms of effectiveness and potential side effects.<br>‚óâ  Break down the causes and consequences of sleep deprivation, examining the physiological, cognitive, and emotional effects.<br><b>Evaluate</b>‚óâ  Assess the effectiveness of implemented sleep strategies and treatments through self-reflection and objective measures.<br><b>Create</b>‚óâ  Design personalized sleep improvement plans based on individual needs and preferences.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 160px; padding-right: 160px;">An interactive online course, accessible on both web and mobile platforms, integrates multimedia learning, simulation games, and online forums across four structured sections.<br><br>This course will progressively guide learners from basic comprehension to advanced application and critical evaluation of sleep science concepts, facilitating a comprehensive understanding and practical application of sleep hygiene practices. It is designed to be self-paced, allowing learners to access the materials at their convenience, ensuring flexibility in their learning journey. <br><br>To motivate learners and monitor their progress, the course is gamified: a point system is integrated throughout the course. Learners' achievements are tracked through these points, and the points for each week will become stars which can be later traded on the MOOC platform for more free courses. Upon completion of the course, they will receive certificates with badges that reflect their earned stars in each module, recognizing their level of mastery and engagement.</p>
